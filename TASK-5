Introduction:
The objective of this scenario is to establish a robust and secure AWS environment using Network Firewall. This setup will enhance network security while allowing controlled internet access.
Components:

VPC Setup:

Create a Hub-VPC with CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16
Configure three subnets within this VPC:
a. Firewall subnet (10.0.1.0/24)
b. Jump-Server subnet (10.0.2.0/24)


Create a Spoke-VPC with CIDR block 20.0.0.0/16
Configure two private subnets within this VPC:
a. Spoke-1-Subnet (20.0.1.0/24)
b. Spoke-2-Subnet (20.0.1.0/24)


Internet Gateway:

Set up an Internet gateway (iGW) and NAT gateway to allow communication between the Hub-VPC and the internet
Attach it to the VPC and configure appropriate routing


Network Firewall:

Deploy an AWS Network Firewall in the Firewall subnet (10.0.1.0/24)
Configure firewall rules to control traffic between the internet, Hub-VPC and Spoke-VPC


Routing Configuration:

Set up route tables for each subnet to direct traffic appropriately:

Security Groups:

Create and configure security groups for resources in Hub and Spoke VPCs to further control inbound and outbound traffic


Testing and Verification:

Launch one EC2 Instance ( Jump-Server ) in the Hub-VPC
Launch two EC2 instances ( VM-01 , VM-02 ) in the Spoke-VPC
Test connectivity and verify that traffic is properly routed through the Network Firewall
Confirm that security policies are enforced as expected

1- VM-01 can ping VM-02 , but VM-02 can not ping VM-01
2- VM-02 can SSH on VM-01, but VM-01 can not SSH on VM-02
3- Jump-Server can SSH on VM-01, and can not SSH on VM-02



For detailed guidance on setting up the Network Firewall, please refer to the AWS documentation:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/getting-started.html
This task will result in a single-zone architecture with enhanced security through the use of an Internet gateway and Network Firewall, similar to the diagramÂ provided.
