Task 9

Setting Up a Site-to-Site VPN Between Two AWS Regions

*Objective:*
Create a secure and encrypted Site-to-Site VPN connection between two different AWS regions, enabling private networks in each region to communicate securely with each other.

*Steps:*

*1. Create Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):*
- *Region A:*
  - Create a new VPC and define an appropriate CIDR block.
  - Create Subnets in different Availability Zones.
  - Create and configure an Internet Gateway and attach it to the VPC.
  - Create a Route Table and update the routes to allow internet connectivity.

- *Region B:*
  - Repeat the same steps to create a VPC in another region (Region B).

*2. Create Virtual Private Gateway (VGW) in Each Region:*
- *Region A:*
  - Create a Virtual Private Gateway.
  - Attach the VGW to your VPC.
  - Update the Route Table to add a route pointing to the VGW.

- *Region B:*
  - Repeat the steps to create and configure a Virtual Private Gateway in Region B.

*3. Create Customer Gateway (CGW):*
- *Region A:*
  - Create a Customer Gateway pointing to the public IP address of the Virtual Private Gateway in Region B.

- *Region B:*
  - Create a Customer Gateway pointing to the public IP address of the Virtual Private Gateway in Region A.

*4. Create Site-to-Site VPN Connections:*
- *Region A:*
  - Create a VPN Connection between the Virtual Private Gateway in Region A and the Customer Gateway pointing to Region B.
  - Download the VPN configuration and save it for later use.

- *Region B:*
  - Repeat the steps to create a VPN Connection between the Virtual Private Gateway in Region B and the Customer Gateway pointing to Region A.

*5. Configure Route Tables to Route Traffic Between Regions:*
- *Region A:*
  - Update the Route Table in the VPC to add a route pointing to the VPN Connection for connecting to Region B.

- *Region B:*
  - Update the Route Table in the VPC to add a route pointing to the VPN Connection for connecting to Region A.

6. Test Connectivity:
- Launch EC2 instances in the Subnets of both regions.
- Verify that the EC2 instances in Region A can communicate with the EC2 instances in Region B over the VPN.
