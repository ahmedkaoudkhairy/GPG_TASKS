Task-2 "Creating a VPC Peering Connection & Transit gateways in AWS "

1- Creation of VPCs:
You will create two separate VPCs, named VPC1 and VPC2, with distinct CIDR blocks to avoid IP address conflicts. 
Each VPC will be isolated and function as an independent network environment.

2- Configuration of Subnets:
Within each VPC, you will create multiple subnets distributed across different availability zones (AZs) for high availability and fault tolerance.
Subnets will be appropriately sized and configured to accommodate the required number of EC2 instances.

3- A peering connection will be 
established between VPC1 and VPC2 to facilitate private communication between resources residing in each VPC.
This peering connection will allow traffic to flow securely between the instances in VPC1 and VPC2, leveraging private IP addresses.

4- Create Transit Gateway and Configure Attachment Between VPCs that you created previously
