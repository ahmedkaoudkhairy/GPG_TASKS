Introduction:
The objective of this scenario is to establish a robust and secure AWS environment utilizing a single Availability Zone architecture with an Internet gateway and Network Firewall. This setup will enhance network security while allowing controlled internet access.
Components:

VPC Setup:

Create a VPC with CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16
Configure three subnets within this VPC:
a. Firewall subnet (10.0.0.0/16)
b. Customer subnet (10.0.2.0/24)
c. Internet gateway subnet (10.0.2.0/24)


Internet Gateway:

Set up an Internet gateway (igw-1232) to allow communication between the VPC and the internet
Attach it to the VPC and configure appropriate routing


Network Firewall:

Deploy an AWS Network Firewall in the Firewall subnet (10.0.4.0/28)
Configure firewall rules to control traffic between the internet and the customer subnet


Routing Configuration:

Set up route tables for each subnet to direct traffic appropriately:
a. Internet gateway subnet: Route internet-bound traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to the Internet gateway
b. Firewall subnet: Route internal traffic to VPC local and internet traffic to the Internet gateway
c. Customer subnet: Route all outbound traffic through the Network Firewall


Security Groups:

Create and configure security groups for resources in the customer subnet to further control inbound and outbound traffic


Testing and Verification:

Launch EC2 instances in the customer subnet
Test connectivity and verify that traffic is properly routed through the Network Firewall
Confirm that security policies are enforced as expected



For detailed guidance on setting up the Network Firewall, please refer to the AWS documentation:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/getting-started.html
This task will result in a single-zone architecture with enhanced security through the use of an Internet gateway and Network Firewall, similar to the diagram provided.
